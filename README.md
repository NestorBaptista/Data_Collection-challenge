# Data_Collection-challenge

This project focuses on web scraping and data analysis related to Mars. The goal is to collect data from various sources and gain insights into Mars-related information.

### Project Deliverables

The project consists of two parts, each with its deliverables:

#### Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
In this part, the Mars news website was scraped to extract the titles and preview text of news articles. The scraping results were stored in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a title and preview pair.

#### Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
In this part, Mars weather data was scraped and analyzed. The data was extracted from an HTML table using Beautiful Soup or Pandas. It was then organized into a DataFrame with specific column headings. The analysis included answering questions about the number of months on Mars, Martian days' worth of data, coldest and warmest months, lowest and highest atmospheric pressure months, and the number of terrestrial days in a Martian year.

### Summary
The following tools and functions were used for data collection and analysis:

Splinter: Automated browsing was performed using Splinter to visit web pages and extract HTML code.
Beautiful Soup: HTML parsing was performed using Beautiful Soup to extract specific elements from web pages.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis were done using Pandas DataFrame.
Matplotlib: Data visualization was performed using Matplotlib to create plots and charts.

This project demonstrates the utilization of web scraping techniques and data analysis using Python libraries to collect and analyze Mars-related data. The tools and functions mentioned above enable efficient data extraction, manipulation, and visualization for gaining insights into Mars news articles and weather patterns.
